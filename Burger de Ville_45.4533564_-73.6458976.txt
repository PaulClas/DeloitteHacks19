if you want to know the taste of a real burger, you will definitely like it. Sociable workers will help you with the choice. In McDonalds and other fast food places you will not be fed like that. fresh non-frozen burgers. I recommend.
Pretty good burger for a fair price. Far from excellent, but it's worth visiting. Meat pattie is made from fresh ground beef, and placed directly on a grill .Vast choice of extras and free refills.
If your looking for what may very well be the BEST Montreal burger you need to eat here.. One of the few places in town where you can safely eat a medium rare burger and WOW is it great.. Made exactly the way YOU want it.. Don't expect a fancy place with linens, This is a rather typical burger jount.  But you will get clean super friendly service great food and reasonable prices. I LOVE THIS PLACE and will be going back many many more times..
Oh by the way I didn't try the the steak yet but you can see the meat they serve and the steaks looked really great.  perfectly aged and marbled. Pretty sure that will be the next item I'll try..
Great little gourmet burger joint in Montreal West. Can customize burger and has other options : sandwiches, salads, ribeye steak, poutines. You order at front and then they bring your food out to your table, pretty quick service. Burgers were flame grilled and fantastic. Few places where you can order hamburger to order... Medium rare, etc.
Seating was comfortable.   Staff was helpful.  I didn't care for the cafeteria style ordering and the burger was just okay for all the hype. Good choice of toppings.
