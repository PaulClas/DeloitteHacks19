The guy taking my order was very very nice but after 1am this place looks like a shelter with over 10 hobos in the fast food sleeping on the tables leaving no place for actual customers... makes the places look unsafe as I was paying 2 people approached me asking for money while I was paying for my hamburger. They need to keep this place in control because I personally will be thinking 5-10 times before coming here! The place needs better management that’s for sure
Opened recently,  clean,  and tasty fast food, mostly young crowd. Whopper Wednesday offers a good deal. Food is microwaved so it does cool down fairly quickly. Don't sit in line with the doorway in the winter, you get a good blast of cold air each time someone enters,  because the door closes slowly,  and there's no baffle for the wind.  Also great for the coupons they distribute offering deals on their offerings.
Service isn't bad, though the periodic badgering from beggars and belligerent lowlifes alike killed it for me. After months of patronage after long classes at Concordia nearby, the last things I need are obnoxious meal neighbors. You've just lost a regular customer.
Home of the Whopper. What more can I say? This location was clean, the staff were friendly and the food was fast. 4 stars only because it’s fast food and probably isn’t that good for you. My fiancée says we all ought to be eating more plants!
Had a very bad experience here today first time at this location. I ordered three meals with my friends and all the burgers were tasteless and fries was like fried in old oil and bad taste. I recommend to all donot come at this location.
