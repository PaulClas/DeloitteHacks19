Love this burger place! Fair price and unlimited topping! (Even though I put too much and my burger ends up messy). Poutines and ribs are very good too! It gets crowded for lunch during weekdays...
Unfortunately for their delicious burgers everything else about this place was a disappointment. First it can’t decide whether it is a fast food joint or a sit down restaurant. Let me explain you order at the counter but get served at your table. For a place called burger de ville I was expecting more then just the basic choices of burgers. Then they have steak and ribs (again weird for a burger place). The staff rude and confused as they messed up orders of more then one table. The women’s washrooms was filthy. But they do make a great tasting burger.
Excellent! Great service, fast and efficient. Meat as usual fresh. Great quality.
Really solid burger and fries,  with a good variety of toppings/condiments available. The restaurant itself was clean and well-kept.The half fast food, half eat-in restaurant vibe is kind of strange though.
The food was amazing truly authentic. However my customer service experience was disgusting and disappointing considering the manager at the store was scofing and continued to say racist slurs I don’t understand why considering Montreal is a very friendly place. So just a heads up for people of colour.
