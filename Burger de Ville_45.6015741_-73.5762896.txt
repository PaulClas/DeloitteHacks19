When you first walk in, the place is somewhat dull and ordinary. Thankfully the burgers are a lot more interesting. Made fresh with a decent selection of free toppings. My medium well burger was juicy and flavorful. A regular burger with fries and a drink will run you about 14$ tax in. Seating is limited so I wouldn't recommend it for large groups. Take out available. Will definitely try again.
Amazing, staff and food, been coming here ever since they opened, it's simple and low key, highly recommend. I brought my own bread and they toatesd it for me right on the grill, made my burger even better! Oh  and they also serve steaks and babyback ribs!
The burgers are incredible ! Small place, 50 places approximately. Good place for lunch !
This place used to be good but -in the past few months-  has been consistently serving bland burgers, possibly because they keep losing the cooks for some reason. The fries are getting worse, too. The fries portions are smaller. The service is not as friendly.

You order medium well burger that tastes burnt and it comes off as a dry well done.

Just tried it now and some of the toppings tasted odd. Got an upset stomach the last time. That's just the last nail in the coffin. 

The owners need to get their act together. You can only coast on your other branch's reputation for so long.

If you want a great burger go their branch in Westminster. I dunno what this place is but it's nowhere close.
Not a huge fan of burgers but theirs are simply amazing! Went there several times and theyâ€™re consistent with the quality of their food. Never been disappointed
