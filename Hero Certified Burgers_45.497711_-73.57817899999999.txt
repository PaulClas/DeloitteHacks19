Awesome place really clean. Burgers are mouth watering and Halal. This burger store located in downtown Montreal. You can select your own toppings for the burger. They take cash debit or credit card.
Awesome place!!! Love their food, the staff is so friendly and welcoming. Love the big variety of the menu, from beef to veggie patty, everything halal and the service is quick. I go there every week, and will continue visiting this place. Recommend to everyone who wants to eat something good, fast and come out happy:)
The fries are ordinary. The burger is decent. But their attitude and behavior is our of the world. The lady who took our order was extremely friendly. Good Ambiance.
Super friendly staff, and great food. I normally don't get fries with my burgers, but I always make an exception here, cuz their sweet potato fries are delicious!
Pretty good burger! Onion rings are crispy and good.
