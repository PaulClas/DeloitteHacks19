Their burgers are so good. Service is slow unfortunatly. But the it's worth the wait.
One of the two best burgers Iâ€™ve had was here, without a doubt best in Montreal. Honestly everyone needs to go to this place (I especially recommend the Diabla)
Terrible customer service.

Apparently the customers who order online arent worth their time. Had to have an order cancelled because they wouldnt verify it through skipthedishes.

Said they took delivery orders until 9:15.

Ordered at 8:40.

What's the point of signing up for a delivery service if you're just going to ignore the orders.

Get it together.

Wasted my time.

It's a shame cause their food actually looked really good.
10 minute wait because everything is cooked fresh to order. Excellent quality, charming staff. Burgers have unique topings and run 8$-10$
Best burger in Montreal so far. I had grilled chicken burger (its not on the menu but they can make it for you) and it was full of flavors! Good food at really good price and the staff is polite too. Keep it up guys!
