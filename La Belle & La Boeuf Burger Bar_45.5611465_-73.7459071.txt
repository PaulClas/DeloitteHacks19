The food was decent enough, and so was the staff. There are board games and the like provided which are really fun and handy in a group of friends. Biggest downside is the overpricing for the kind of food they provide.
The food was amazing, vibes was incredible. The drinks menue as a lot of option and is SUPER GOOD! I will recommend this restaurant to all of my friends.
Fantastic place with simply amazing burgers and really nice staff!  Very welcoming and comfortable.  Really cool menu as well with some fun items
First time out to this location. Great food. Great place. Would recommend to others.
Very good burgers and sides, including the soup. Price is not bad for the taser of the food, the quantity and service.
