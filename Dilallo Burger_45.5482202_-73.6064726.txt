Good service and food if you're hungry late at night. Place is nice enough but suffers a crisis of identity. They call it a sports bar but it just feels like a pub with the patrons just staring at the barmaid's assets. Not recommended for a romantic evening or outings with the kids.
Honestly was disappointed. Nothing special at all. It wasn't clean, unpleasant service, very casual setting. I wouldn't go back.
I've been eating at dialllo burger for years, this franchise is unfortunate. I called to place an order for delivery and when the order arrived I did not receive my beverage. I offered to pay the driver for just the burger and fries but he said that I had to pay the whole amount and that I had to call the store to tell them and then send me another coke ?! The burger and fries were not very good sort of cold, not warm. I called the store to tell them and they were very not helpful. The lady said that if I brought back the food to the store I would be refunded?!  Don't know how that works but I didn't get something that I paid for and a patronizing response from the store. You lost a long time customer.
The steak poutine was delicious! I really recommend it and the staff was friendly.
Very close to home, always get a takeout order so I don't really care about the ambiance but for the times I stay there waiting for my food, the staffs are nice and chill and the place is relax too, with a couple of big screens to watch sports (but i just prefer to read a journal). The food is great, I always get a nice and big cheese bacon burger with a poutine, the burger is nice and juicy, full of quality ingredients with big crispy chunk of lettuces and tomatoes. The poutine and the fries overall of pretty dope too. It's not that expensive, I think around 13$ for a big cheese bacon burger trio, a poutine and a beverage. If you don' t like the way the burger is upside/down, just change the buns places lol.
