I don't know who these people are who are posting lately, but this place has been closed for a year now. sadly, it was a great place. but it's gone. :(
I miss this place. I blame the municipality for the construction in front which has literally been there for two years now, or more. It's pathetic -- they even started dressing up the construction with frilly lights and advertisements because it was such a permanent feature of the street.
The burgers themselves are great, and I really enjoyed the fries as well! they do burgers and they do them well. The deduction in starts is from the fact that the service is considerably slower than average when you look at the fact that it is primarily a take-out restaurant. Pricing was a bit on the high side as well but that could easily be overlooked if the service was quicker. Staff was super friendly on the other hand!
You have to get the fois gras burger which is about $20 but it's worth it. The sweet potato fries are also amazing
Great place downtown for REAL hamburgers. Creative sides and toppings. Sweet potato fries are excellent. Service is good. The place is super trendy, so often the music is too loud and not to my taste. Also, the seating area is limited, so your best bet is to go during non peak hours. Pricing is on the top end of reasonable (15$ for burger and drink), but the price is worth it for the quality.
