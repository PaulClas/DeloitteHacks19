Great burgers and if you want quality and great service come here. I often place a order with my work colleagues and they have our food ready when we get there.
Amazing food! Great burgers and poutine, nice atmosphere and great service. Excellent value. Close to the airport as an added bonus üëç
Awesome restaurant. The only thing better than the food was the service, will definitely return! Monia was a delight to be served by.
Friendly atmosphere. Staff treated us like regulars even though we were there for the first time. Food is casual and good. Before ordering, a staff member politely asked us if we did not mind moving to another table for another bigger party. We were properly compensated for the inconvenience after our meals!
Excellent food! Burger super juicy and full of flavour. Had a poutine on the side, gravy was delicious, but fries got mushy fast. So just eat faster next time hahaha. It was a little pricey to change my fries to a poutine, but the size of it was worth it. :)
