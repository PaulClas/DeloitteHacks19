Burgers are really good, and the menu offers a lot of variety.
I personally like that you can chose your patty for every burgers(beef,chicken,vegan)... 

The menu offers vegan options and it's cool. However, but they don't have vegan buns and the only alternative is a lettuce wrap which cost an additional 2$(over the "free" buns).

You can have a burger + fries for around 20$, which is kinda correct.
I liked the food; I had a small burger. The meat was very good,no complaints there.
The only real downside was the service ; it was super slow and they forgot something twice in our order...
Seems to have gone a little downhill... avoid the grilled chicken burger. It was smaller than usual, and what's more, raw in the middle. 
Beef burgers are the safer bet.
Amazing burger and great rootbeer float. Don't suggest getting medium rare unless you want just raw crumbling meat (the patties are thin, but stacked). Was still good but will go for medium well next time.
Great burgers. Very fresh tasting meat. 
Our sides were all good as well, the (basic) mac and cheese was ok.
Caramel and salt cookie, a la mode dessert was great!

Big draw back, no alcohol license. Thus -1 star.
