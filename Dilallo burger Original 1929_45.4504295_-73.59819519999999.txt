Waitresses need to take care of their customers. Some have been there to long and just get to comfortable that customers will come back because Diallo's is landmark. Wrong way of thinking competition is everywhere so take care of customers they pay your salary. No customers=no pay
Good service, great food at and affordable price. Little problem with the owner and the staff tho. Will go back!
food was good...but I guess I'll never ask for delivery
When I ordered (and I live just around 1.2km distance)
If they could deliver within 30 to 35 min... as I had other plans...
They said yes... no woories...

The dilevery took 1hour 3min...

I paid full price plus tip...

The FOOD was COLD like from the fridge

Never again sorry
I've been going to this Dillalo burger since I was old enough to walk. 
My uncle lived down the street and me and my siblings and cousins would get to walk there for lunch whenever we visited. 

I now bring my daughter here. 

Nothing like a Dillalo burger and the experience :)
I usually order for delivery and they are always very nice. Love the onion rings and the veggie burger.
