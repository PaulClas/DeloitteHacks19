Great burgers and amazing poutine! The gravy (brown sauce) was probably the best I've ever had. And the dessert... Cheesecake mixed with carrot cake, so good! Great spot ðŸ‘Œ
All the ingredients are super fresh and high quality. The staff are super friendly too! I highly recommend this place
The best burgers you'll ever taste! Amazing food and great customer service. Highly recommended!!!
5/5 for the burger. Was one of the best Iâ€™ve ever had.  Generous portions. Worth the long wait. The fries and poutine were great but the fries could be a bit less oily. Overall, I highly recommend it!
Food is good, service is way too slow (1 hour + & it was not that busy, they need to review their management) & the staff is unwelcoming (they act as if you're bothering them...) Also, they make you pay extra for certain toppings & forget to add it in your burger or they just mix up orders... The place was freezing cold, it was unbearable. The tables were dirty. The only good thing about this place is the food, nothing else.
