Good food as always. Friendly staff, lots of space to sit with family and friends. Only thing cannot do an order of more than 2 sandwiches or burgers over the phone for pick up, only available for delivery.
very simple interior design. very simple chair and table. toilet is not good. an order making method. uyhun price. Have car parking.
Sandwiches are awesome.  Atmosphere is cold and empty.  2 tv's are on but tuned to different stations.  Random channels blaring nonsense.  Quite annoying.   5 stars for the food.  Zero stars for the atmosphere.
Lovely food. I and my family love this place. The best place for fast food and nice ambience.
Original, great quality, delicious! Courteous service. Reasonable price.
